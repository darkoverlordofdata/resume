Static Page generator

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
$ sudo npm install huginn -g
```


### Create a new application

```bash
$ huginn create <appname>
$ cd <appname>
$ huginn build
$ huginn serve
```

### Usage

    Usage:
      huginn create PATH

      cd PATH
      huginn build [--drafts]
      huginn serve

    Options:
      -d  [--drafts]    # publish _drafts folder
      -h  [--help]      # display this message
      -v  [--version]   # display version

### Blog Conversion

I started using Jekyll, but I don't enjoy using Ruby. So I created Huginn.
Huginn uses Liquid.js, and has the same folder structures. The config file is
named differently,so that I can (hopefull) run both side by side.
